And for young children whose parents are busy taking part in the games, there was also a surprise visit from the Duchess of Sussex.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On April 17, Meghan ducked into the British Embassy tent to join a dozen kids and some of their moms as they listened to a reading of classic children’s book Hairy Maclary—a classic series she admitted to the group that she has read to her own children, Archie and Lilibet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With Harry, the couple started their third day at The Hague's Zuiderpark with track and field events featuring competitors from 17 different countries. Dressed in a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39744872/meghan-markle-invictus-games-day-3-outfit/) data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brandon Maxwell jacket" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Brandon Maxwell jacket</a>, Meghan and Harry immediately gravitated to some of the competitors present.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We're going to be cheering you on all the way!" the duchess told members of Team Ukraine, who stopped for selfies and photographs with the royal couple. They also took time out to chat with athletes from Team Iraq before rushing over to pet a service dog from the Netherlands team. "Well I could just fall in love with you!" Meghan cooed as she stroked golden labrador, Castor, as Harry chatted to owner and veteran Eric Hartwich, who suffers from severe PTSD after being deployed to the frontlines of Bosnia in 2007.</p><img alt="the hague, netherlands april 17 prince harry, duke of sussex and meghan, duchess of sussex interact with members of team netherlands during the athletics on day two of the invictus games the hague 2020 at zuiderpark on april 17, 2022 in the hague, netherlands photo by lukas schulzegetty images for invictus games the hague 2020" title="Invictus Games The Hague 2020 - Day 2" width=2500 height=1667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1391907137.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lukas Schulze</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan pet a service dog.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At the shot put final, both Harry and Meghan cheered and clapped as they watched Team Ukraine’s Rodion Sitdikov get a gold medal-winning result of 9.46 metres. It was a third medal for the Ukrainian competitors, with Artem Lukashuk and Ivan Heretsun winning silver and bronze medals in the long jump.</p><img alt="prince harry invictus games" title="prince harry Invictus games" width=3000 height=1999 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/large-invictus-games-the-hague-2020-day-2-copy-1650221135.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lukas Schulze/Getty Images for Invictus Games The Hague 2020</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Prince Harry greets members of the Ukraine team.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With three events happening almost simultaneously on Sunday, the Sussexes wasted little time in moving around, heading over to the Sports Campus for a sitting volleyball match between Australia and Netherlands.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paralympian gold medalist and former Invictus medalist Jaco Van Gass sat with the Sussexes during the match. The British Army veteran, who suffered life-changing injuries after surviving a rocket attack in 2009, first met Harry in 2011 and has remained a friend since. "[Harry’s] back with his own people, he's back in an environment that he's so natural in and that he cares about," he said. "I think that's the most important thing—this great depth of care that he has for the games."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Meghan left in the afternoon, Harry to cheer on competitors at the archery arena. Clapping for each country taking part, including USA, South Korea, and Romania, Harry was also joined by crew from his forthcoming Netflix production about the games.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It’s incredible to watch you in action," the duke told U.S. Navy veteran Gabriel "Gabe" George from of Jacksonville, Florida, who lost an arm in 2008 after arriving home from a deployment. Heart of Invictus, which will stream on Netflix later this year, will tell the stories and share the journeys of competitors like Gabe as they prepare for the games, which were delayed for two years due to the pandemic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tomorrow, Prince Harry will continue his time at the Invictus Games, an event he told guests during Saturday's opening ceremony was "full of people of substance, of resilience, of strength, and of heart."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He echoed similar sentiments when giving his first interview in Europe since stepping away from his senior working royal role over two years ago. Speaking to youth reporters Sophia, 11, and Jay, 12, from Netherlands' <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GgpzhbiCV0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="De Kindercorrespondent" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">De Kindercorrespondent</a>, a new outlet focused on making the voices of young people heard, he shared what made the games so important to the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"These individuals signed up to serve, but at the same time once they had their uniform taken off or removed, they're still serving," Harry said. "Life is about service, service to others, being kind to each other, friendship."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked what his wish for Archie and Lilibet is, he replied, "To grow up in a better world. To grow up in a fairer world, a safer world, a more equal world. It's not going to be easy, but I will never, ever rest until I, as a parent, have at least tried to make the world a better place for them."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
