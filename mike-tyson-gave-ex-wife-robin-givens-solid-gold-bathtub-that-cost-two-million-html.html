Mostly, they were due to a rape accusation and conviction, his temper, his jealousy over his wives, and his financial woes.</p><p id=par-3_30>The truth is lavish spending was a huge part of Tyson’s life. He came from a background that didn’t allow it and embraced it fully when he had the chance.</p><h2 id=h-the-price-of-luxury-how-much-did-the-high-life-cost-mike-tyson>The price of luxury: how much did the high life cost Mike Tyson?</h2><p id=par-4_48>Though Tyson didn’t come from money, he certainly knew what to do with it when he found it. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Washington Post</a>, some estimates are that he spent around “$4.5 million on cars and motorcycles, $3.4 million on clothes and jewelry, and $7.8 million on personal expenses.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_41>For a while, it seems as though no price was too high for Tyson. He spent a fortune on two white <a href=#>Bengal tigers</a> and their trainer. The big cats cost $140,000 and then their trainer was another $125,000 each year.</p><p id=par-6_27>However, this was nothing compared to the bathtub that he purchased for his first wife, <a href=#>Robin Givens</a>, and a birthday party for her that totaled around $410,000.</p><p id=par-7_36>It was a bathtub that he ended up keeping when the two divorced, but eventually, Tyson parted with it. He sold it to a British billionaire for around half the price that he paid for it.</p><h2 id=h-the-story-behind-tyson-robin-givens-and-the-bathtub-between-them>The story behind Tyson, Robin Givens, and the bathtub between them</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_36>Tyson married Givens in 1988 and the two <a href=#>divorced in 1989</a>. Although Tyson’s autobiography says that Givens was a good step for him, she filed for a divorce claiming that Tyson was abusive and jealous.</p><p id=par-9_21>Perhaps the jealousy had cause, as Tyson claimed that he walked in on an intimate moment between Givens and Brad Pitt.</p><p id=par-10_23>It has been said that the two had a very rocky relationship from the start. Therefore, the two never had kids together.</p><p id=par-11_37>The kids did not come for Tyson until his second rocky marriage to Monica Turner in 1997. With <a href=#>Turner, two kids</a> were born, but it ultimately ended in divorce after she claimed that Tyson cheated on her.</p><h2 id=h-where-are-givens-and-tyson-today>Where are Givens and Tyson today?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_32>Givens is doing well, but she is staying under the radar, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>. Though there are rumors that she received a $10 million settlement during her divorce, she denies it.</p><p id=par-13_36>Because of this, it is estimated that her net worth is only around $1 to $3 million. However, it may change since the actor released her newest movie Saints & Sinners: Judgment Day in February 2021.</p><p id=par-14_26>After her divorce from Tyson, she remarried in 1997 to <a href=#>Svetozar Marinkovic</a>, but it was also short-lived. The two divorced in 1998. She has two children.</p><p id=par-15_35>Tyson would eventually get his world worked out, and he married his third wife, Lakiha “Kiki” Spicer, in 2009. They have two kids. He recently developed, with her help, a Broadway show, The Undisputed Truth.</p><p id=par-16_43>At one time, it was estimated that Tyson amassed approximately $300 million, but that was before his troubles really began. Today, it is estimated that his net worth is around $3 million, which isn’t bad considering he lost it all at one time.</p><p id=par-17_16><strong>Related: <a href=#>Mike Tyson Owed $60 Million In Debt—Here’s His Secret to How He Turned Things Around</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrfEZquyq5%2Bjeqit1Z5knrBdrLansYyrppuhnmK0qsLEp6pmq5%2BhtqV5xqijnWWSlsGpwNSbZK2gkal6pLvSrWStr59iuqq4y6Kmp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html&text=Mike%20Tyson%20Gave%20Ex-Wife%20Robin%20Givens%20a%2024K%20Solid%20Gold%20Bathtub%20That%20Cost%20%242%20Million&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html&title=Mike%20Tyson%20Gave%20Ex-Wife%20Robin%20Givens%20a%2024K%20Solid%20Gold%20Bathtub%20That%20Cost%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html&title=Mike%20Tyson%20Gave%20Ex-Wife%20Robin%20Givens%20a%2024K%20Solid%20Gold%20Bathtub%20That%20Cost%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html&title=Mike%20Tyson%20Gave%20Ex-Wife%20Robin%20Givens%20a%2024K%20Solid%20Gold%20Bathtub%20That%20Cost%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmike-tyson-gave-ex-wife-robin-givens-solid-gold-bathtub-that-cost-two-million-html.html&description=Mike%20Tyson%20Gave%20Ex-Wife%20Robin%20Givens%20a%2024K%20Solid%20Gold%20Bathtub%20That%20Cost%20%242%20Million" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./star-trek-picard-reveals-happened-riker-troi-tng.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Star Trek: Picard Reveals What Happened To Riker And Troi After The Next Generation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./microsoft-acquires-pen-technology-from-ntrig-ltd.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Microsoft Acquires Pen Technology From N-Trig Ltd">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
