His rise to fame came early on when he appeared in the hit Disney Channel’s Even Stevens. His career started a few years earlier, but it was Even Stevens that pushed him into the limelight. From there, LaBeouf went on to some great feature film roles that included Holes, I, Robot, Disturbia, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and the first three of the Michael Bay Transformers series. Then came that infamous left-turn down Crazy-Town Lane.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SHIA LABEOUF ACCUSED OF BROWNFACE</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shia-900x589.jpg><p>Shia LaBeouf has been involved in numerous crazy incidents, which we’ll detail further down. However, his latest is a lead role in the David Ayers movie <a href=#>The Tax Collector</a>, where he is being accused of appearing in “brownface”. It is on this movie that LaBeouf decided to get an entire chest tattoo and where he is being accused of brownfacing, which is a variation of blackface, where a white person impersonates people of brown skin to include Hispanics.</p><p>Director Ayers took to Twitter to combat these accusations.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Really important answer – Shia is playing a whiteboy who grew up in the hood. This is a Jewish dude playing a white character. Also the only white dude in the movie ?‍♂️ <a href=#>https://t.co/PS6foJwQXV</a></p>— David Ayer (@DavidAyerMovies) <a href=#>July 1, 2020</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I grew up hood and I’m a whiteboy. Chicano culture is inclusive – I’ve seen whiteys, Asians, Blacks, Filipinos all putting in work for the hood. It’s part of street culture. <a href=#>https://t.co/PS6foJwQXV</a></p>— David Ayer (@DavidAyerMovies) <a href=#>July 1, 2020</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Even if its not brownface, Shia still got that crazy, crazy chest tattoo for real. There’s really no explaining that.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>ECCENTRIC OR JUST PLAIN WHACK</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shia2-900x507.jpg><p>To his credit, Shia LaBeouf is very much known for getting into character. From shaving down a front tooth to getting an entire chest tattoo, LaBeouf takes it to the extreme. But while that is good for his on-set persona, taking “crazy” into his real-life has only found him trouble time and time again.</p><p>During a press tour for his movie Borg vs. McEnroe, which he played tennis legend John McEnroe, he told Esquire in a <a href=#>revealing profile</a>, “I’m a buffoon. My public outbursts are failures. They’re not strategic,” LaBeouf said bluntly. “They’re a struggling motherfucker showing his ass in front of the world.”</p><p>So, it seems he is well aware of what he is doing, after the fact. Because he seems to have no control of himself in the moment. He even told Esquire that it was finally time to “take ownership of [his] shit” and he needs to “clean up [his] side of the street.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SHIA LABEOUF CRAZY ON SET</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shia3-900x506.jpg><p>It’s kind of like a who’s who when it comes to Shia LaBeouf’s list of miscalculations. They include (and are certainly not all) a 2005 incident where he threatened a neighbor with a knife after said neighbor insulted LaBeouf’s mother. A 2007 incident where LaBeouf was arrested for trespassing after refusing to leave a Chicago-area pharmacy. In 2008, LaBeouf was involved in a traffic accident which was deemed not his fault but upon arriving, the officer in said, “It was immediately apparent to officers responding on the scene that LaBeouf was intoxicated and he was subsequently placed under arrest.”</p><p>In 2010, after his appearance as <a href=#>Indiana Jones’</a> son, Mutt Williams, in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, he told reporters at the Cannes Film Festival that he felt the movie “dropped the ball” and also mentioned that series star Harrison Ford felt the same way. We will note, we are in full agreement with LaBeouf on his assessment of the film.</p><p>The list goes on: Bar fights, hooking up with married co-stars (well hello Megan Fox), hooking up with non-married co-stars (hi there, Isobel Lucas), and according to co-star Rupert Grint (Harry Potter series), taking LSD for his part in the movie Charlie Countryman.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>SHIA LABEOUF PLAGIARIZES THE WORLD</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shia4.jpg><p>In December of 2013, Shia LaBeouf released a self-directed film, Howard Cantour.com. This short was also written by LaBeouf and this is where the trouble began. Buzzfeed <a href=#>broke the news</a> that LaBeouf lifted some material (words and artwork) from a 2007 comic book by <a href=#>Daniel Clowes</a> and while LaBeouf initially said to have been “inspired” by Clowes’s work, Clowes had this to say. “I was shocked, to say the least, when I saw that he took the script and even many of the visuals from a very personal story I did six or seven years ago and passed it off as his own work.”</p><p>As pressure mounted, LaBeouf finally tweeted, “I fucked up.” But more needed to be said. So, LaBeouf started tweeting apparent heartfelt apologies. Turns out, those were also plagiarized. Finally, LaBeouf went above and beyond, as he does with most of his characters. He hired a plane to skywrite “I’m sorry Daniel Clowes” all across Los Angeles. The fallout from his admittance was huge, so big that LaBeouf had this to say, “In light of the recent attacks against my artistic integrity, I am retiring from all public life.” IF only.</p><p>LeBeouf followed that shortly with an appearance for his next movie, Lars Trier’s Nymphomaniac. It was an appearance where LaBeouf wore a paper bag over his head with the words, “I Am Not Famous Anymore.” Like we said, if only.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>THERE WAS THIS TIME…</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shian-900x506.jpg><p>…Shia LaBeouf watched all his movies and live-streamed his facial reactions. He called his experiment #ALLMYMOVIES. Fans even joined in to tweet his funniest face reactions.</p><p>…Shia LaBeouf claimed he was raped during his <a href=#>#IAMSORRY</a> performance. His description of the incident, “One woman who came with her boyfriend, who was outside the door when this happened, whipped my legs for ten minutes and then stripped my clothing and proceeded to rape me… There were hundreds of people in line when she walked out with disheveled hair and smudged lipstick,” he wrote. “When [LaBeouf’s girlfriend] came in she asked for an explanation, and I couldn’t speak, so we both sat with this unexplained trauma silently. It was painful.” It should also be noted that his collaborators, &nbsp;Luke Turner and Nastja Säde Rönkkö, offered some important clarifications of the incident, “As soon as we were aware of the incident starting to occur, we put a stop to it and ensured that the woman left” Turner said in a tweet.</p><p>…Shia LaBeouf began a <a href=#>#HEWILLNOTDIVIDEUS</a> campaign that was aimed directly at President Trump, which began during his inauguration. The campaign, according to LaBeouf, was set up to live-stream and have passers-by deliver the words “He will not divide us” as “many times, and for as long as they wish.” The campaign lasted for a while, but public concern and safety were the cause of it moving. And move it did, from location to location, turning into what Shia LaBeouf called the biggest game of Capture the Flag as the live stream now showed a flag with the words, He Will Not Divide Us written on it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno522onnLmpmep6Wbe6nAzKU%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html&text=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Just%20Topped%20Himself%2c%20This%20Is%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20Hes%20Done&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Just%20Topped%20Himself%2c%20This%20Is%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20Hes%20Done" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Just%20Topped%20Himself%2c%20This%20Is%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20Hes%20Done" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html&title=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Just%20Topped%20Himself%2c%20This%20Is%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20Hes%20Done" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshia-labeouf-html.html&description=Shia%20LaBeouf%20Just%20Topped%20Himself%2c%20This%20Is%20The%20Craziest%20Thing%20Hes%20Done" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./burt-reynolds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Burt Reynolds">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./scientific-benefits-december-babies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="People With A December Birthday Live Longer, Happier Lives">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
