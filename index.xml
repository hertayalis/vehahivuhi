Refrigerate the crème brûlées one more before serving them warm. It is customary for crème brûlées to be served at room temperature. Alternatively, if you like it cold, return the ramekins to the refrigerator. For best results, keep them refrigerated for 30 to 45 minutes before serving (no longer, otherwise the sugar crust may begin to soften).
