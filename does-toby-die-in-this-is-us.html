The NBC drama has been that way from the start and, as cathartic as some episodes are, the tears are also at times because of in-show tragedies. And throughout all of the flash-forwards that have been shown leading up to Season 5, fans have speculated on what they mean for the fate of different characters.</p><p>In some cases, fans are concerned for <a href=#>Toby</a>. He has been in a couple of the flash-forward scenes, though it could be argued that the scenes in which he is shown take place at different times in the future. It’s a little confusing, but at this point in the series, that’s probably what the This Is Us writers are aiming for. And fans are constantly in a tizzy over theories and questions about what will happen.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Toby die in 'This Is Us'?</h2><p>That very question is enough to send some This Is Us fans back to their dwindling supplies of Kleenex to ponder life’s tragedies. But some fans believe he could be dead in the future on This Is Us, even if he hasn't been absent from some of the future scenes. Some argue that Toby’s heart attack from early in the series could be what leads to a sudden death.</p><p>Again, it's super heartbreaking because This Is Us has a way of ripping out your heart and continuing to torture you while it’s still beating. Chris Sullivan, who plays Toby, has never come out to reveal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toby’s ultimate fate</a>. He also doesn’t know much more than fans, and that means, as of right now, we can assume Toby is safe.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The lack of Kate and Toby in the future is making me very nervous 😭 <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Px16YtVedY</a></p>— Aisha (@Kitobear13) <a href=#>March 25, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"You know that Dan [Fogelman, the show’s creator] and the writers are going to have surprises and twists and turns all along these paths," Chris told Entertainment Weekly ahead of the Season 5 premiere. "And there is no straight line from point A to point B. There's just not a lot that we either know at this point or can share."</p><p>Thanks a lot, Chris.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Toby and Kate are likely divorced in the future.</h2><p>Chris has already confirmed that <a href=#>Kate and Toby won't be together</a> in those future flash-forwards, but the Season 5 finale of This Is Us gave us more of a glimpse into the reason why. Although fans have been concerned that <a href=#>Kate might die</a> in the future, that remains to be seen. But what was seen was Kate getting married to music teacher Phillip (Chris Geere).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait... Kate and Toby aren’t together anymore??? And she’s marrying the music teacher??? <a href=#>#ThisIsUs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/F6sMqkMWCL</a></p>— Devin 🐺 (@GeauxDevin) <a href=#>May 26, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>This flash-forward came shortly after it was revealed that Toby had gotten a job in San Francisco and that he didn't have much time before he had to go. The experience made Kate realize that she always put Toby's happiness before her own.</p><p>If fans are worried that the reason why Kate is getting remarried is Toby's death, they likely don't have much to worry about. We've already seen him in flash-forwards. Toby not being in this one isn't that surprising — most people don't go to their ex's wedding.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are multiple 'This Is Us' future timelines.</h2><p>Toby is alive in one of the future timelines on This Is Us. It’s the one where Rebecca is seemingly on her death bed and Toby is tasked with bringing chalk to Kevin’s house. In that one, Kate is the only family member still missing, so her fate is questionable. But, at the very least, This Is Us fans know Toby lives 10 or so years into the future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Further into the future, however, Kate and Toby's son Jack welcomes his first baby into the world with his wife. Kate and Toby’s adopted daughter is also present at the time, but neither Kate nor Toby are there. Of course, that can be chalked up to one or both of them being on the way or in a totally separate city at the time. But it does lend a question mark to Toby’s fate in the more distant future.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ytppuxXZm2pnnIp2StoJmoeqq%2FjK6q</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html&text=%27This%20Is%20Us%27%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Want%20to%20Lose%20Toby%2c%20but%20It%20Could%20Still%20Happen%20%28SPOILERS%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html&title=%27This%20Is%20Us%27%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Want%20to%20Lose%20Toby%2c%20but%20It%20Could%20Still%20Happen%20%28SPOILERS%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html&title=%27This%20Is%20Us%27%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Want%20to%20Lose%20Toby%2c%20but%20It%20Could%20Still%20Happen%20%28SPOILERS%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html&title=%27This%20Is%20Us%27%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Want%20to%20Lose%20Toby%2c%20but%20It%20Could%20Still%20Happen%20%28SPOILERS%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-toby-die-in-this-is-us.html&description=%27This%20Is%20Us%27%20Fans%20Don%27t%20Want%20to%20Lose%20Toby%2c%20but%20It%20Could%20Still%20Happen%20%28SPOILERS%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashley-benson-haircut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashley Benson Haircut on Instagram">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stefania-lavie-owen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stefania LaVie Owen Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
